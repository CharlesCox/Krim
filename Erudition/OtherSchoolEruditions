Red Mantis Magic School

While any thug can commit a murder, proper assassination requires finesse and guile.

School of Aethereal Astrologia
 Your magic is inspired by the stars above; how they
 interact with one another, what their geometry with
 Golarion means at any given time, and the things that
 lurk between the stars. You may be an attendant of
 schools like The College of Dimensional Studies in
 Katapesh with its incredible astrolabes, or The
 University of Korvosa in Varisia with its mathematical
 focus on the stars. Wherever you hail from, celestial
 bodies are both guides and tools to your spellcraft.

SCHOOL OF DWIMMERIC ENTERTAINMENT
 Throughout the world, magic and performance are interlinked, and
 your studies reflect that. Whether you intend on performing on stage in
 operatic performances yourself (as do many graduates of Taldor’s
 Kitharodian Academy) or you prefer to take a more managerial or
 backstage role (a fine aspiration for those hailing from schools like
 Absalom’s White Grotto), your magic will enhance any performance to
 new heights.

School of Medical Arcana
 Biology is a mystery waiting to be properly understood,
 and through the arcane, you believe you can unravel it.
 Whether you attend colleges such as the prestigious
 Lepidstadt University or the Venicaan College of
 Medicaments and Chirurgery, you use the internal
 anatomy of all living things to further your magic. While
 the arcane is not perfectly equipped to heal wounds in
 the way other traditions of magic are, you can still
 otherwise find ways to aid the body.

School of Penumbral Sculpture
The shape of a shadow is sculpted through obstruction
 and radiance, an oscillating pendulum between
 luminescence and obscurity. The school is said to have
 originated from mages who traveled the netherworld.
 There is said to be lessons and tomes in Shadow
 Absalom (in particular, the highly exclusive Guiltless
 Academy), but the practice is held among many of the
 more secretive magic schools across Golarion such as
 Dusk Hall in Nidal. A wizard of this school recognizes
 that the imagination and the unknown are made
 stronger by what lies in shadow.

School of Planar Jurisprudence
 Throughout the universe and the planes beyond it, there
 are those who seek order through sovereign authority.
 From aeons who wrote the fundamental rules of reality,
 to psychopomps that judge the dead, to archons who
 f
 ight for justice and devils who punish the sinful,
 practitioners of law are found everywhere. The greatest
 politicians, legislators, and attorneys study at schools such as Egorian Academy of the Magical Arts or Almas
 University, and focus their studies on perfecting the law
 as proposed by those planes concerned with it. From
 diabolist lawyers to akashic bureaucrats, these wizards
 rewrite our universe with through light and shadow.

School of Wandering Steps

 In days bygone, wizards were known for traveling the
 world on foot and showing up in the right place when
 needed. These wizards would travel to see the wonders
 of the world, spreading magic and teaching others their
 ways. Inmoderntimes, some still live out this lifestyle in
 the footsteps of figures like Old Mage Jatembe or
 Cobyslarni. You may have attended a formal education
 and left in favor of seeing the world, you may have
 traveled with a teacher who showed you the ways of the
 world, or maybe you just learned what you did by simply
 living your life.
