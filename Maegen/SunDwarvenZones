Lots of Constructs and Larger Structures
Modular research, so a new construct would require a power source, a form, and a function but once researched a component could be used
in conjuction with other types to create a new construct. Also does not have the barrier between constructs and wondrous architecture, so a skyship would be a project with power from Fire, Form Vehicle and Function various
