School of the Ebon Mausoleum
Situated in Mechitar, Geb's capital, the Ebon Mausoleum is not only a seat of power for many Blood Lords, but also one of the most reputable schools of necromancy on the continent. Though this college is ancient and mostly interested in "traditional" necromancy, clever students and researchers often propel the field forward using new methodologies.

A classical necromancy school made in the image of (and taught by) upper class vampires, ghosts and skeletons.
A mix of physical, mental, void and death effects, frightened condition.

School of the Twilight Sages
Yled is home to a number of important necromantic colleges, the most well-known being the Mortuarium. The twilight sages there carry out experiments on flesh and bone, seeking to unlock the secrets of life and death. While the twilight sages generally arenâ€™t actively malicious, most are willing to perform human experimentation in pursuit of knowledge with little regard for the casualties.

Theme I was going for
Horrific transmutations, twisted flesh and bone, body horror, tentacles.
A mix of enhancing and enfeebling effects, acid damage, sickened condition.

One of the more practical, militaristic branches among the Yled magical schools, the Tenebrous Beyond was given the mandate of studying the type of planar magic favored by Nex himself in order to develop suitable countermeasures against Nexian armies and spellcasters.
