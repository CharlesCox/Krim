School of the Ebon Mausoleum
Situated in Mechitar, Geb's capital, the Ebon Mausoleum is not only a seat of power for many Blood Lords, but also one of the most reputable schools of necromancy on the continent. Though this college is ancient and mostly interested in "traditional" necromancy, clever students and researchers often propel the field forward using new methodologies.

Theme I was going for
A classical necromancy school made in the image of (and taught by) upper class vampires, ghosts and skeletons.
