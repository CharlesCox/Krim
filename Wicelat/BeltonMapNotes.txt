    => 712 * 2 = 1424 miles across for the full map => 2,291 km

Make greiky_base.jpg in DungeonFog Deius

Forests

Spray Brush with guide densities and Generic Tree

Guide:
    Start Placement Rate 1. Density 1.45 place the core of the forest.
    Then reduce to Density 1. and place around the edge.
    Then either go manual or density 0.25 and place some more farther out.

Forests on detail map - start with Symbol Scale 20 


Put cities on Layer - -3.
Also should've used layers for other things but filtering apparently works on something else.
Use symbol size 45 for small city
Use 8b2c10 as primary city color
